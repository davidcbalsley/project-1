Project 1: Study Buddy


Description
An app that collects a group of users for the purposes of arranging a study group or meet up. The app will take the user’s availability and send the group a list of the most accommodating meeting times. Once a meeting time is chosen by the group, users will enter the location they will be prior to the meeting. The app will generate a list of diplomatic locations to meet at based on user’s locations.


User Story
As group of people who want to meet up, I want to find out the best time and place to meet up so that we don’t waste time figuring it out while being fair to the groups respective schedules.
